    <h3>Description</h3>
     <p><strong>Sel roti</strong> is a traditional Nepali fried bread or rice doughnut. It's made from a batter of ground rice, sugar, and sometimes flavorings like cardamom or banana. The batter is shaped into a ring and deep-fried until golden brown, resulting in a crispy exterior and a soft, chewy interior. It's often enjoyed as a snack or during festivals and special occasions in Nepal.</p>
