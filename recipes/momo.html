    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> The word “momo” is a phonetic transcription of the Tibetan word མོག་མོག (pronounced as mog mog). Historically, it is believed that the dish spread from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal to Tibet or vice versa. One theory suggests that Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe from Tibet, where they traded, and brought it home to Nepal. Another theory is that a Nepalese Newari princess introduced momos to Tibet after her marriage to a Tibetan king in the late fifteenth century.</p>
